How to Play
Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to enter player names and their respective symbols (a single letter).
Players take turns choosing a position on the board by entering the number of the cell they wish to place their symbol in.
The game will announce the winner if a player successfully lines up three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game will declare a draw.
Players can choose to start a new game or quit after each match.
